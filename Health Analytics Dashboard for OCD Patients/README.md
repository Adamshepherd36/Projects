### Project Questions:
- What trend can be observed in the diagnosis count over time?
- Which compulsion type has the highest average obsession score?
- How many patients were diagnosed with OCD in January 2015, and what does this suggest about that time period?
- What is the relationship between the diagnosis count and the obsession types?
- What could be inferred about the diagnosis trends over the years based on the line chart?
- Which ethnicity has the lowest patient count, and how does this impact the analysis?

## Overview:
This project involves the creation of a health analytics dashboard aimed at providing a visual representation of OCD patient data. By integrating various data visualization techniques, the dashboard enables healthcare professionals to explore patient demographics, compulsion and obsession types, and diagnosis trends over time. The project begins with data cleaning and preparation, followed by the design and development of visualizations using tools like SQL, Excel and Power BI. The final product is an interactive dashboard that can be used to inform clinical decisions and enhance the understanding of OCD patient profiles.

## Findings

What trend can be observed in the diagnosis count over time?
- The diagnosis count of OCD patients fluctuates over time, with noticeable peaks around 2016 and a general decline towards 2022. This trend suggests that the number of new diagnoses has varied, possibly due to external factors such as healthcare accessibility or awareness campaigns.

Which compulsion type has the highest average obsession score?
- Among the compulsion types, Harm-related obsessions have the highest average obsession score of 20.65, indicating that this type of obsession is associated with more severe cases of OCD.

How many patients were diagnosed with OCD in January 2015, and what does this suggest about that time period?
- In January 2015, 23 patients were diagnosed with OCD. This higher count suggests a possible increase in awareness or detection efforts during that period.

What is the relationship between the diagnosis count and the obsession types?
- The relationship shows that Harm-related and Contamination-related obsessions have the highest patient counts, which could indicate these obsessions are more commonly recognized or reported among OCD patients.

What could be inferred about the diagnosis trends over the years based on the line chart?
- The line chart indicates that the number of diagnosed OCD patients increased around 2016 but has since seen a decline. This could be due to various factors, including changes in healthcare practices, patient awareness, or even underreporting in later years.

Which ethnicity has the lowest patient count, and how does this impact the analysis?
- The African ethnicity group has the lowest patient count, with 324 patients. This lower count might impact the generalizability of findings related to ethnic-specific OCD trends and highlights the need for more inclusive data collection.

## Conclusion
The Health Analytics Dashboard for OCD Patients has successfully compiled and visualized critical data, providing valuable insights into the characteristics and trends among OCD patients. The data reveals a nearly balanced gender distribution among patients, with slightly more males (50.2%) than females (49.8%). Washing and Counting are the most frequent compulsions, affecting 321 and 316 patients respectively, while Harm-related and Contamination are the most common obsessions, impacting 333 and 306 patients respectively.

The diagnosis trend analysis shows varying patient counts over the years, with significant fluctuations from 2014 to 2022. This insight can guide healthcare providers in understanding when and why these peaks occur, potentially leading to better resource allocation during periods of higher diagnosis rates.

One area that stands out is the challenge of balancing development between mobile apps and websites. Given the significant impact of both platforms on patient engagement, itâ€™s critical to consider whether to enhance the website to match the app's performance or to further develop the app due to its current effectiveness. A more in-depth exploration of the relationship between the length of membership and the preferred platform (app or website) is recommended to make a well-informed decision.
