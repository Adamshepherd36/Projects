### Fixed Asset Roll Forward
The Fixed Asset Roll Forward statement tracks the movement of a company's fixed assets over a period of time. It typically includes the beginning balance of fixed assets, additions (such as purchases or improvements), deductions (such as disposals or write-offs), and the ending balance. This statement helps in understanding how the value of fixed assets changes over time due to acquisitions, depreciation, and disposals. It is crucial for managing capital investments and ensuring that assets are used efficiently.

### Financial Liability
The Financial Liability statement details the company’s obligations that arise from borrowing or other financial activities. It includes information on the beginning and ending balances of liabilities such as loans, bonds, or other forms of debt. The statement also records new debt taken on during the period, as well as repayments. This information is essential for understanding the company’s leverage, interest obligations, and overall financial risk. Managing financial liabilities effectively is critical to maintaining the company’s solvency and creditworthiness.

### Equity Schedule
The Equity Schedule outlines the changes in the company’s equity over a specific period. It includes the beginning equity, any new capital injected, net income or losses for the period, dividends paid out, and the ending equity balance. The equity schedule provides insights into how the company is building or depleting its equity base, which is vital for understanding the company’s financial health and the value being created for shareholders.

### Cash Flow
The Cash Flow statement provides an overview of the cash generated and used by a company during a specific period. It is divided into three main sections:

Operating Cash Flow: Cash generated from core business operations, such as sales revenue and operating expenses.
Investing Cash Flow: Cash used in or generated from investments in assets, such as purchasing equipment or selling investments.
Financing Cash Flow: Cash flows related to borrowing, repaying debt, issuing stock, or paying dividends.
The cash flow statement is crucial for assessing the liquidity of the company and its ability to generate cash to meet obligations, invest in the business, and return value to shareholders. It is one of the most critical indicators of financial health and operational efficiency.

### Questions and Findings

**How have Trade Receivables changed from 2014 to 2016?**
- Trade Receivables increased from $143.9 million in 2014 to $164 million in 2016. This indicates that the company is selling more on credit, which could be a sign of growing sales but might also suggest potential cash flow issues if the receivables are not collected in a timely manner.

**What is the trend in inventory levels over the years 2014 to 2016?**
- Inventory levels have gradually increased from $89.7 million in 2014 to $100 million in 2016. This could indicate an expectation of higher future sales or an issue with overstocking. The company needs to ensure that inventory is well managed to avoid excessive carrying costs.

**How has the company’s Cash position changed from 2014 to 2016?**
- Cash in bank accounts increased significantly from $16.1 million in 2014 to $220 million in 2016, while cash on hand increased from $2.4 million to $32 million over the same period. This increase in cash reserves suggests improved liquidity, potentially from increased profits or new investments.

**What has been the trend in the company’s financial liabilities?**
- Financial liabilities have decreased from $610.4 million in 2015 to $605 million in 2016, indicating the company is gradually paying down its debt. This reduction in debt helps reduce interest expenses and improve the company’s financial health.

**How has EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) changed from 2014 to 2016, and what is its forecast?**
- EBITDA increased from $309 million in 2014 to $525 million in 2016, reflecting strong operational performance. The forecast indicates continued growth, reaching $705 million by 2021. This shows positive business momentum and efficient cost management.

**What is the expected net income growth over the forecast period?**
- Net income is expected to grow from $343 million in 2017 to $402 million in 2021. This steady growth indicates consistent profitability and potential for increased shareholder value over time.

**What are the trends in the company’s equity over time?**
- Equity increased from $485 million in 2014 to $1,601 million by 2021. This substantial growth in equity is a strong indicator of the company’s ability to generate profits and retain earnings, reflecting long-term financial stability.

**What insights can be drawn from the cash flow forecast?**
- Operating cash flow is expected to increase steadily from $367 million in 2017 to $380 million in 2021, suggesting the company is generating sufficient cash from its operations to support growth and meet its obligations. The consistent positive cash flow allows for dividends, debt repayments, and reinvestment in the business.

**What is the expected impact of debt repayment on financial liabilities?**
- The company is forecasted to reduce its debt from $615.8 million in 2014 to $366.7 million by 2021. This aggressive debt reduction strategy will decrease interest expenses and improve the company's financial leverage.
